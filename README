This is an example Perl Mojolicious application. It is a book catalogue,
enabling you to create new books, search for and edit existing ones.

This is still a work in progress, not much works. But you might enjoy reading
the code and building upon it.

Thanks go to the most excellent Mojolicious example I have found to date:

In my first Mojolicious application you might find:

- bad code
- misunderstood concepts
- bugs
